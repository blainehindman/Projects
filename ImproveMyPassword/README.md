# Improve My Password

## Description
This project is a simple HTML webpage, that uses jQuery, Javascript, and CSS to improve a user's entered password. Using the jQuery library makes this project responsive and reactive for the user. Password requirements are becoming more complex in order to protect privacy, data, and information. As this is a necessity, it also has become strenuous to remember these complex passwords. Due to these password complexities, many people use the same base password for everything. This website suggests three passwords for the user to consider, based on their enter password.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to demonstrate my knowledge of jQuery, along with understanding the concepts of DNS, web hosting, and SEO.

## Future Development
I will update this website as I continue to learn more about SEO, and the best ways to drive traffic to websites.
