# Blaine Hindman's Personal Projects

This repository is designed to showcase my projects, that are unrelated to my work or school projects. My hope is that this repository will demonstrate my knowledge of the multiple different coding processes across the Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering fields.

As I pursue my Computer Engineering Degree at Washington State University (estimated graduation, Fall 2021) I will continue to add to this repository. 

If you have any questions, job inquiries, or concerns, please feel free to reach out to me via email, blainehindman@outlook.com.
